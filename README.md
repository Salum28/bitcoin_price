# Bitcoin Price App

The following project was made in a Flutter course i made, and the main goals of this app were:

* Learn how to use APIs in Flutter Apps;
* Learn how to make http requests using http dart library;

Also, one of the app's goals was to pratice layout creation and customization.
## How the Code Works

When you inicialize the app, just click in the orange button, and a http request will be send to Blockchain API, and the API will return the bitcoin price in BRL, so, when the result is returned, the app will show the updated value in your phone screen.
